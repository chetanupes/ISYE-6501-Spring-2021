## Question 12.1

Describe a situation or problem from your job, everyday life, current events, 
etc., for which a design of experiments approach would be appropriate.

## Answer 12.1

I am presently working towards loosing weight. This is a very good situation 
where I can use DOE to see what factors (exercise and diet with their 
variations) will help or have the largest impact on my targets. It can also help 
in identifying important interactions between the factors. 


## Question 12.2

To determine the value of 10 different yes/no features to the market value of a 
house (large yard, solar roof, etc.), a real estate agent plans to survey 50 
potential buyers, showing a fictitious house with different combinations of 
features.  To reduce the survey size, the agent wants to show just 16 fictitious 
houses. Use R’s FrF2 function (in the FrF2 package) to find a fractional 
factorial design for this experiment: what set of features should each of the 16 
fictitious houses have?  Note: the output of FrF2 is “1” (include) or  “-1” 
(don’t include) for each feature.

## Answer 12.2

# Experimental Design

With the current selection we have 10 factors and 16 runs.Factorial designs are 
useful as screening experiments because they require relatively few runs to 
estimate main and interaction effects.

# Randomization

While we have no control over how the data will be collected, by selecting a 
random sample from the data, we are incorporating randomization into the model.

# Blocking

Blocking is not used in this design. This is a screening experiment and we are 
interested in the effects of all the factors.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(FrF2)
```

```{r message=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
set.seed(42)
des<-FrF2(nfactors = 10,nruns = 16, 
          factor.names = c('Yard', 'Parking','Rooms','Basement', 'Price',
                           'Location','School Nearby', 'Supermarket Nearby',
                           'Luxary Home','Train Station Nearby'))
```

## Question 13.1

For each of the following distributions, give an example of data that you would 
expect to follow this distribution (besides the examples already discussed 
in class).

a.	Binomial   
b.	Geometric   
c.	Poisson   
d.	Exponential  
e.	Weibull


## Answer 13.1

A probability distribution is a statistical function that describes all the 
possible values and likelihoods that a random variable can take within a 
given range. This range will be bounded between the minimum and maximum possible 
values, but precisely where the possible value is likely to be plotted on 
the probability distribution depends on a number of factors. These factors 
include the distribution's mean (average), standard deviation, skewness, and 
kurtosis.

1. Binomial
Applying for a n Data Scientist jobs with observation being selected or 
rejected. Thus, the number of times a person gets selected might follow 
a binomial distribution

2. Geometric   
If I randomly ask people which university they went to, until I meet someone who 
went to Georgia Tech. Thus, in this example p is the probability of finding 
someone who went to Georgia Tech after asking X number of people. In this case, 
we can say that X follows a geometric distribution.

3. Poisson   
The number of car accidents per hour in a day might follow a Poisson Distribution

4. Exponential  
In the above example the time between two accidents might follow the exponential 
distribution. 

5. Weibull
Modeling the time to failure of an engine by a car manufacturer might follow
Weibull distribution.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
```

## Question 13.2

In this problem you, can simulate a simplified airport security system at a busy 
airport. Passengers arrive according to a Poisson distribution with Lambda 1=5 
per minute (i.e., mean interarrival rate mu1 = 0.2 minutes) to the ID/boarding
check queue, where there are several servers who each have exponential service 
time with mean rate mu2 = 0.75 minutes. [Hint: model them as one block that has 
more than one resource.]  After that, the passengers are assigned to the shortest 
of the several personal-check queues, where they go through the personal scanner
(time is uniformly distributed between 0.5 minutes and 1 minute). 

Use the Arena software (PC users) or Python with SimPy (PC or Mac users) to build 
a simulation of the system, and then vary the number of ID/boarding-pass checkers
and personal-check queues to determine how many are needed to keep average wait 
times below 15 minutes.  [If you’re using SimPy, or if you have access to a non-
student version of Arena, you can use Lambda 1 = 50 to simulate a busier airport

## Answer 13.2

I started this assignment using the student version of Arena but quickly hit the 
road block with the limitation of the student version. I then started this 
exercise in the Virtual Lab of Gatech. Below is the approach I followed with 
various results summarized.MOst of this approach was discussed in the office hour

# Basic Model: 5 Scanners and 1 ID Check resource 

1. Created the two processes required ID check and Scanners. ID Check is an 
Exponential distribution and Security lines have a uniform distribution as per 
the assignment.

2. Scanner sorting decision box is used to manage the queue.The expression used 
to manage the the traffic is as follows:

  a) Scanner 1: Minimum of all the scanner queues 
  
  b) Scanner 2 to 6: Queue greater than previous Scanner and less than the rest 
     of the scanners.

The model is tested with 5 replications/iterations for a 24 hour cycle for this 
simulation.The results are depicted in hours.

![Base Model (Image from newer student version of Arena).](C:/Users/cheta/OneDrive/Desktop/Setup.png)

## Model 1: 5 Scanner and ID Check (1 resource)

![Table 1.](C:/Users/cheta/OneDrive/Desktop/5 model.png)

This model was able to bring down the waiting time to much lower than 15 mins 
but there are resources which are not used as can be seen in the table above 
with Scanner 4 and 5 zero average waiting time.

## Model 2: 3 Scanner and ID Check (1 resource)

![Table 2.](C:/Users/cheta/OneDrive/Desktop/4 model.png)

Based on the previous model we saw that we were not using all the resources and 
thus for this model we used only 3 scanners. The results above show that the 
average wait time now is much larger using 3 scanners and 1 resource at ID 
check. We can will further improvise to find the best model.

## Model 3: 4 Scanner and ID Check (1 resource)

![Table 3.](C:/Users/cheta/OneDrive/Desktop/3 model.png)

With this model we can see that we were able to bring down the average waiting 
time from the previous model but not to the extent we want to. The first three 
model helped to see how many scanners we can work with. In the coming model I 
worked to optimize the resources in the ID check in the subsequent models.


## Model 4: 4 Scanner and ID Check (6 resource)

![Table 4.](C:/Users/cheta/OneDrive/Desktop/2 model.png)

With 6 resources at the ID check the model performed well but again Scanner 
2,3,4 are unused.

## Model 5: 4 Scanner and ID Check (4 resource)

![Table 5.](C:/Users/cheta/OneDrive/Desktop/1 model.png)

The final model gave the best results in terms of using all the resources and 
also bringing the average below 15 minutes.There are many ways to optimize this 
simulation and adding more constraints also takes time run those simulations.
