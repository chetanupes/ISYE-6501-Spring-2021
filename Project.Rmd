## Question

This project should be done individually. 

  1. Pick a project for which you think at least three different Analytics models 
     might have been combined to create the solution.  

  2. Think carefully and critically about what models might be used to create the 
     solution, how they would be combined, what specific data might be needed to use 
     the models, how it might be collected, and how often it might need to be 
     refreshed and the models re-run.  DO NOT find a description online (or elsewhere) 
     of what the company or organization actually did.  I want this project to be 
     about your ideas, not about reading what someone else did.

  3. Write a short report describing your answers to 3.

## CASE STUDY
I have chosen the following case from IBM for my project.
https://www.ibm.com/case-studies/wintershall-dea-ai-exploration. A key challenge in early exploration 
for oil and gas producers is making sense of vintage data. Time is critical and finding, organizing, and assessing this data can take months and years with significant financial and opportunity costs.

## Goal

The primary goal of this analysis is to assess the data at various stages of 
asset development and decide if the company will be interested in developing 
the project in full scale.
 
This analysis will include all the elements of the data analysis such as 
descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive. In this document I will outline the 
whole process of how different stakeholders are involved along with what data, 
models and inferences derived, and how we can tie up the whole process. The 
stakeholders involved doing majority of the analysis work will be Geologists/
Geophysicist, Reservoir/Production Engineers, Drilling engineers and Decision 
makers (people who have the authority to take actions). 

I will define the data used, questions which needs to answered in all 
stages along with the inferences made using the format suggested: Given, Use and 
To. There are many analyses involved in the life cycle of such a project and not 
all of these analysis require analytics application as learned in this course and 
thus, I will only be talking about some of the processes where we can effectively use 
analytics. Since, we can have multiple solutions using different models, I will 
state the models which I feel will give the best answer in a particular 
scenario. 

Let us find what all data we can have in doing this analysis:

  1.	Seismic data
  
  2.	Well Log data
  
  3.  Drilling Data
  
  4.	Production Data and Reservoir Data 
  
## Exploration Phase: Geologists/Geophysicist and Reservoir Engineers

Before drilling occurs, information gathering takes place by geologists and 
geophysicists to identify potential of the project and the potential drilling 
locations by answering the following questions:

  •	Review seismic surveys. Seismic surveys use sound waves to produce images of 
    the rock formations below the Earth’s surface. These surveys can be completed 
    in two dimensional (2D) or three dimensional (3D) formats. 

        Given: The seismic data

        Use: Deep-learning methods such as Neural Network 

        To: Identify the geologic structure

  •	Logs consist of data derived from various wireline tools which are run into 
    the wellbore after drilling. While being pulled back up to the surface, the tools
    measure various characteristics of the rock formations and fluids. From these 
    measurements, we can determine formation lithology (eg. sand, shale, limestone, 
    etc.), porosity, permeability, and fluid type.

        Given: The logging data

        Use: k-Mean Clustering which is an unsupervised learning technique. We can 
             also used supervised learning techniques such as ensemble models 
             (Random forest) or even Regression to predict /characterize the lithology 
             based on the past data where we know the factors which can be used to 
             identify the lithology   

        To: Create lithology groups and further analyse these groups to extract porosity, 
            permeability and fluid type using domain knowledge.

Once all the above data is reviewed, if there appears to be a promising prospect, 
the Geology team will recommend to the company where to drill an “exploration 
well”. This exploration well will confirm whether there is oil or gas present 
and to measure the volume of the resource. Also, the data from the exploration 
is used build a static reservoir model which will used to develop a dynamic 
model which can simulate the overall future performance of the assets by bringing 
in new wells and managing the existing wells.

## Drilling & Completion: Drilling Engineers, Geologists and Reservoir Engineers

Once minerals are confirmed and surface leases obtained, the company is ready to 
drill. Analytics can be used extensively in drilling to handle drilling problems 
such as stick slip vibration/hole cleaning, pipe failures, loss of circulation, 
BHA whirl, stuck pipe incidents etc. This can save millions in replacement costs 
and maintenance, NPV, lost production, minimize industry bias, and drive 
intelligent business decisions.

      Given: Real time drilling data. This data includes both surface and downhole 
             senser data.
      
      Use: Supervised learning algorithms such as Decision Tree/Random forest to 
           divide the data into different dysfunctions using domain knowledge. Also, 
           we can use regression to predict the dysfunctions if we know of the factors 
           and the signature of the dysfunctions from past/domain knowledge. 
      
      To: Help the drilling team to troubleshoot/ identify potential dysfunctions 
          real time saving business millions in lost productivity.
      
The information gained by drilling each well can be used in the future to further improve drilling efficiency. Once the drilling is complete and the company is confident in the success of the well, the well is prepared for production, through a process called completion. Along with this example there can be other cases where analytics can be used, such as how we can optimize the whole drilling operation which involves movement of the rig to the site, all the required equipment’s needed or how we can minimize rig downtime. For example: If we have one drilling rigs and 5 drilling locations, how can we use to optimize the movement of the rig from one location to other with all the constraints around it.

## Production & Processing: Production and Reservoir Engineers

Production is the process of bringing hydrocarbons to the surface where the crude 
oil or natural gas is prepared for processing. We can again use analytics to help 
us a wide variety of applications. 

  •	Natural Gas generally flows under its own pressure through the wellhead into the gathering system pipeline. The      gas from the pipelines flow to and is processed at the compressor station, which takes the water and impurities      out of the gas by means of inlet water knock out vessels or scrubbers and is compressed through to a dehydrator      to dry the gas and on to a sales line.

  •	Oil production is more complicated and varies depending on the weight of the oil, how easily it flows, the           porosity and permeability of the rock, the pressure in the oil reservoir and the pressure of other fluids such as     natural gas and water in the reservoir. 

        Given: Production data and reservoir data which can include fluid properties 
               and reservoir pressure data 

        Use: Time series analysis 

        To: Predict the future production for a well. This in turn can tell us about 
            the economic limit and the productive life of the well before abandonment. 

  •	Some wellbores may only require production tubing for gas and/or oil to flow to surface, but in most cases a rod     string and bottom hole pump is lowered inside the production tubing and controlled at surface which is referred      to as artificial lift method.Also, this data can be combined with the facility data to show the whole life cycle     of the project together. 
        
        Given: Based on the data available for each well with all the surface and 
               downhole constraints 

        Use: Simulation. This is a complex process with lots of pieces tied together 
             thus simulation is the best way to understand how all the process work well together.

        To: Optimize the production for each well

We can combine all this information to create a dynamic reservoir model to help the company understand how to manage and optimize the existing assets at different levels. Also, the model can be used to come up with an efficient and more informed solution/recommendation regarding drilling new wells and suggestions on how to optimize the productivity of the existing wells.

Let’s now tie up everything in a concise way. Below is a flow chart of the whole process.
