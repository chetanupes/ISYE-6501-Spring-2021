## Question 15.1

Describe a situation or problem from your job, everyday life, current events, 
etc., for which optimization would be appropriate. What data would you need?

## Answer 15.1
As a production engineer I have to make sure that each well production is 
optimized based on the current state of things. For a simple example we need to 
maintain the productivity of a well by making sure that it is economic to flow. 
For this we do optimization. One way to do this is to plan how the fluids will be 
lifted during the well's lifetime. Here the variables are tubing sizes, 
reservoir pressure, flow rate etc. The constraints will be at what rate and 
pressure we want to use with the current size of the tubing. 
The optimization model for this scenario will be to maximize the productivity 
of the well by keeping cost as low by avoiding workovers.


## Question 14.1

The breast cancer data set breast-cancer-wisconsin.data.txt from has missing 
values.
1.	Use the mean/mode imputation method to impute values for the missing data.
2.	Use regression to impute values for the missing data.
3.	Use regression with perturbation to impute values for the missing data.
4.	(Optional) Compare the results and quality of classification models (e.g., 
    SVM, KNN) build using 
    (1) the data sets from questions 1,2,3; 
    (2) the data that remains after data points with missing values are removed; 
    (3) the data set when a binary variable is introduced to indicate missing 
        values.

```{r message=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
#Getting the data
data<-read.table('breast-cancer-wisconsin.data.txt', sep = ',', header = TRUE,
                 stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

#Renaming response variable
colnames(data)[colnames(data) == 'X2.1'] <- 'R'


#Finding columns with missing data
apply(data, 2, function(x) which(x == "?"))

#From the above code we can see that only one column X1.3 has missing 
#values

```
## 1. Use Mean/Mode Imputaion 

For this question we can see that the most of data is in the form of a factor. 
So logically it seems appropriate to do a mode imputation. But we will do both 
imputations here.

```{r warning=FALSE, message=TRUE}

#Using Mean imputation
df<-data
df<-as.data.frame((apply(df,2,as.numeric))) #Converting data type to Numeric
df[is.na(df[,7]),7]<-round(mean(df$X1.3, na.rm = TRUE),digits = 2)

#Using Mode imputation
df1<-data

#Creating a function to calculate mode
Mode <- function(x) {
  ux <- unique(x)
  ux[which.max(tabulate(match(x, ux)))]
}
#Mode for the column Bare Nuclei
d<-Mode(df$X1.3)

#Now replacing the '?' in the column with the mode value
df1$X1.3[df1$X1.3=='?']<-d

```
## 1. Use regression to impute values for the missing data 

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(MASS)
library(glmnet)
library(plyr) 
```

```{r message=TRUE, warning=FALSE}

#Getting the data
cancer<-read.table('breast-cancer-wisconsin.data.txt', sep = ',', header = TRUE,
                 stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

#Separating the missing value rows and creating two data frames
idx<-which(cancer$X1.3=='?')
miss_data<-cancer[idx,]

#Modeling without the missing data
new_data<-cancer[-idx,]

#Building the model
model<-lm(X1.3~X5+X1+X1.1+X1.2+X3+X1.4+X1.5+X2.1, data=new_data)

#Model Summary
summary(model)

#The model is only approximately 70% accurate. Applying the variable selection 
#method we learned for better prediction

##Using Step-wise regression and evaluating the results
ste<-stepAIC(model, scope = list(lower = X1.3~1, upper = X1.3~X5+X1+X1.1+X1.2+
                                   X3+X1.4+X1.5+X2.1),
             direction = 'both',trace = 1)
summary(ste)

#We can see that the step model predicts 6 predictors for the best model.
#Now we will build a new regression model using just the 6 predictors and
#evaluate the model

#New model
new<-lm(X1.3 ~ X1 + X1.1 + X1.2 + X3 + X1.4 + X2.1, data = new_data)
#New model summary
summary(new)

#Testing data
test<-miss_data[,c('X1','X1.1','X1.2','X3','X1.4','X2.1')]

#Predicting
pred<-predict(new,test)

#Binding the predicted data together
total<-data
total<-replace(data,data=='?',round(pred,digits = 0))

```
## Use regression with perturbation to impute values for the missing

```{r message=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
set.seed(42)
d<-data
imp <- rnorm(nrow(miss_data), pred, sd(pred))

#Data also contains negative values using perturbation, thus it requires futher
#investigation

#Binding the predicted data together
purt<-data
purt<-replace(data,data=='?',round(imp,digits = 0))
```

So, we imputed the data using Mean, Mode, Regression and Perturbation. Next step 
is to see if these imputations have helped in classification. I will use only 
KNN for this work.

## Conclusion
The code is also attached with this assignment for reference. After completing 
this part of the exercise the conclusions are as follows:

We can see from the accuracy calculated with and without imputed data to be in 
the same range and thus does not give good evidence that imputation of any kind 
was helpful for this example.
